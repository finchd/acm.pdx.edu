It&#39;s easy, and imagine how your first years would have been without the tutor&#39;s help ;). </p><p>&nbsp;We may have a sponsorships of a classic piece of the internet coming down the tubes; more info on this later. </p><p>&nbsp;If you have suggestions for games, food, sponsorships, or speakers to invite. just mail us at acm@cs.pdx.edu</p><p>&nbsp;;hunter </p><p>&nbsp; </p>','2009-01-16 14:48:26'

'Summer Open Source Bridge','<p>&nbsp;Hello, I know the Summer is not the season for official ACM gatherings, but who says we can&#39;t have fun in the sun? Not all of us get a break from classes, anyway :/.</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a> is a new conference for developers working with open source technologies and for people interested in learning the open source way.&quot; We think that many of the talks given at this conference are central to the open source movement.</p><p>&nbsp;So, on short notice, the PSU ACM is inviting ACM and PSU members/students to <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a> being held in Portland this week! We have a limited number of spots, so make sure to contact us quickly with your PSU student ID number and ACM member ID number, and we will get details to you on how to get your free ticket over the Bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;Hope to see you there!</p><p>&nbsp;;hunter </p>','2009-06-15 11:34:15'
